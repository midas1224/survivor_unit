The goal of this project was to create a system allowing for different styles of upgrades to be added to a player character that has the ability to move, take and deal damage, and apply a variety of effect. 

This project contains modules for scalable abilities, a modifiable upgrade tree, and a surivor-like upgrade system which proposes random upgrades for player damaging abilities and attributes.
